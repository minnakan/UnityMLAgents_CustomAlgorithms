# Unity ML-Agents Gym Wrappers for Example Environments

This project demonstrates solutions for 5 example environments from the Unity ML-Agents [repository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/develop/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md). It also serves as a guide for training agents using custom learning algorithms within Unity.

## Project Structure

The subfolders contain environment executables and code files, each appropriately labelled. For example, `GridWorldDQN.py`.

## Dependencies

To set up the project, please refer to the [installation guide](https://github.com/astralpunchstudios/reinforced-machine-training-environment/blob/main/docs/Install_Unity_MLAgents_Local.md).

Additionally, you will need to install [Stable-Baselines 3](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html).

## Features

- Solutions for Unity ML-Agents example environments
- Custom learning algorithm implementations
- Self-contained Python scripts
